Poppr is an R package designed for analysis of populations with mixed modes of 
sexual and clonal reproduction. It is built around the framework of adegenet's
genind object and offers the following implementations:

- Calculate the index of association and standardized index of association
- Calculate Bruvo's distance (implemented in C for speed)
- Automatically clone-censor data sets based on a population hierarchy.
- Define multilocus genotypes
- Create multilocus genotype tables for analysis with the package, vegan.
- Quickly analyze what multilocus genotypes cross populations. 
- Visualizing Bruvo's distance as a minimum spanning multilocus genotype network.
